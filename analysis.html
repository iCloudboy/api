            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>This report aims to critically analyse and compare cloud services, while considering both the personal requirements of Tip Top Music and relevant literature. Cloud computing refers to the use of virtualised computing sources, housed outside of one’s own data centre. Cloud computing groups together these computing sources and typically offers their combined power on an on-demand, paid via subscription basis. The end user of the cloud computing service can access the service through the web, without needing to know where the servers are physically located. The rise of cloud computing has made a significant impact on the IT industry over the past decade. In 2016, cloud revenue for the four quarters ending in September reached $146 billion, which is a growth of 25% on an annualised basis (Synergy Research Group, 2017). Infrastructure providers such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft striving to create more powerful, reliable and cost efficient cloud platforms.
            </p> <br>
            <h1>Advantages of Cloud Computing
            </h1>
            <p>Cloud computing provides several compelling features that can be attractive to business enterprises, which may seek to alter their business models to benefit from this service. Some beneficial features are as follows:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>No upfront cost</b> - Cloud computing does not require an initial investment into the infrastructure to gain its benefits. This is because cloud computing uses a pay-as-you-go pricing model, where the service provider rents resources from the cloud depending on its own needs and then pay for the usage.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <b>Highly scalable</b> - Infrastructure providers pool together a vast number of resources from data centres across the globe which are easily accessible. This means that an enterprise can expand its service to a larger scale with ease in order to deal with a prompt increase in demand.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <b>Lower operating costs</b> - Cloud services typically groups together its computing services, offering their combined resources on an on-demand basis. These resources can be allocated and de-allocated on-demand in relation to the service provider’s needs. For example, rather than paying for what they believe is the peak load, they can pay for how much they need at the time. This saves on operating costs whenever the demand is low.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <b>Easily Accessible</b> - Due to cloud services commonly being web-based, they are easily accessed from a variety of different devices that are connected to the internet (e.g. Desktop computers, laptops and smartphones).
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <b>Reducing maintenance expenses and risks</b> - By using a cloud based infrastructure, service providers are reducing any computing risks such as hardware failures, as it is left up to the infrastructure providers to maintain their data centres, which they are generally more knowledgeable at managing these risks. This also reduces any expenses associated with hardware maintenance and cuts out the need for training staff for it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Architectural Layers of Cloud Computing</h1>
            <p>The architecture of a cloud computing environment is usually divided into three levels: Software as a service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).</p>
            <h3>Software as a Service</h3>
            <p>Software as a Service (SaaS) is the idea that someone offers a hosted set of software which is running on a platform and infrastructure that is paid by use. Rather than purchasing a full license a user can pay to use the software by use (e.g. hourly). So, if the software is only needed for a limited period, users can just pay for the software during that time, which reduces costs.</p>
            <h3>Platform as a Service</h3>
            <p>Bhardwaj et al., 2010 describes Platform as a Service (PaaS) as “the idea that someone can provide the hardware (as in IaaS) plus a certain amount of application software - such as integration into a common set of programming functions or databases as a foundation upon which you can build your application”. The PaaS level refers to the middle ground of the cloud used for development by programmers and developers to create applications, software and web tools. Developers rent the hardware from an IaaS provider, which they will then use as the platform to build their software, applications and web tools. This allows developers to develop and deploy their applications without the cost and complexity of purchasing and supervising the underlying infrastructure, the IaaS.
            </p>
            <h3>Infrastructure as a service
            </h3>
            <p>Bhardwaj et al., 2010 describes Information as “the delivery of hardware (server, storage and network), and associated software (operating systems virtualization technology, file system), as a service”. This is the foundation level of cloud computing. An IaaS provider is providing a virtual data centre to its buyers which they can rent and access through the web. This reduces costs for the buyer massively, as they do not need to purchase expensive data centres and maintain it themselves, the infrastructure provider takes care of it. Another advantage of renting an IaaS is that it does not require any long-term commitment. The buyer simply rents the resources that they need and can provision their resources on demand. Unlike with PaaS services, an IaaS provider does very little in terms of management, they simply keep the data centre operational. The users of their service must deploy and manage the software services themselves, as the IaaS is simply just providing the data centre for them to do so. This service would be the best suited to TipTop Music, as they can create the website themselves, but rent the service rather than pay to manage it themselves.
            </p>
            <h1>Cloud Service Providers</h1>
            <p>The public cloud market has grown exponentially in the past decade. As seen in figure 1, the public cloud market in 2015 had generated $97 billion in revenue, which is a huge growth from $15 billion in 2010. When this graph was generated in 2015, it was estimated that the public cloud market would generate $114 billion in revenue in 2016, but as mentioned previously, cloud revenue in 2016 was $146 billion, which portrays its rapid growth.
            </p>

            <p><b>Figure 1</b> - Global Public Cloud Market Size</p>
            <p>With this trend in mind, more and more companies are rolling out public cloud computing services, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google’s App Engine. It is important for the user to compare each cloud provider and decide which one is best suited to their application. The following 2 cloud service providers will be considered for TipTop Music’s fanzine website: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure. These two cloud services were chosen based upon RightScale’s cloud computing trends survey taken in 2015. The chart in figure 2 shows that AWS and Microsoft Azure have the highest percentage of respondents running applications on their service. </p>

            <p><b>Figure 2</b> - Public Cloud Usage</p>
            <h3>Elasticity and Scalability
            </h3>
            <p>Elasticity in cloud computing is when computing resources are made available to the user in relation to their applications demand. When an application receives a surge of traffic, more computing resources will be assigned to it during that period. Once the surge in traffic subsides, the amount of resources will return to normal. The advantage to this approach is that users are only paying for what they need. If a user used a local data centre rather than cloud computing, they would have to have enough resources to deal with potential surges in traffic, which would cost dramatically more.
            </p>
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>While cloud computing offers plenty of benefits, there are several concerns that prevent some enterprises from adopting it; with security being arguably the most relevant one. Vaquero et al. (2010) states “Many factors have an impact on cloud security, but it is its multitenant nature that brings the newest and more challenging problems to cloud settings”. There can be huge risks involved depending on what is shared between the users who are sharing resources.
            </p>
            <p>Vaquero et al. (2010) lists the following threats as the most relevant:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Abuse and Nefarious Use of cloud computing</b> - Although IaaS providers may seem that they can provide unlimited storage, network and computing capacity, they have hosted malicious content such as Trojan horses, botnets and software exploits.  This is due to relatively weak registration systems in cloud computing environments. Most services can be registered for by anyone with a valid credit card. This provides the user with anonymity which leaves little consequences for their actions. To prevent this, providers should implement a stricter registration process to deter attacks. Providers could also monitor the credit card used when signing up for fraud.</li>
                <li><b>Malicious Insiders</b> - Malicious IaaS insiders could have a dramatic effect on security due to the fact that IT services and customers are grouped under a single management domain. This combined with a lack of transparency into IaaS provider’s process and procedure can pose a major threat. To prevent this, providers should make sure to create different levels of access to the system. Sensitive information should only be available to those who need it.
                </li>
                <li><b>Insecure Interfaces and APIs</b> - The security of cloud services is dependant upon the security of APIs. APIs that manage and interact with cloud services can be exposed and lead to malicious actions such as denial of service attacks or rack up fees on behalf of the victim.</li>
                <li><b>Account or Service Hijacking</b> - Although account hijacking through methods such as phishing, fraud and exploitation are common issues in IT. The cloud further amplifies these issues as if an attacker gains access to a user’s credentials, they can manipulate data, see what actions and transactions the user has taken part of and redirect the user’s clients to illegitimate websites.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h3>
            <p>Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing platform offered by Amazon. The main features of the service include: low cost, high speed, adaptability, scalability and guaranteed security. The main two services they offer are EC2 and S3. EC2 is amazons elastic cloud computing service. It allows its users to rent virtual machines which they can run their applications on. S3 is Amazon’s online file storage web service. For TipTop music, EC2 is the best suited due to its rapid deployment and elasticity. If a band goes viral, traffic to the website may drastically increase. EC2 adapt to the sudden influx of traffic and provide the appropriate resources. Amazon’s free tier offers 750 hours per month of instance usage for the first 12 months. Due to TipTop music having almost no capital expenditure with the project, amazons free tier would be extremely useful in the early stages of the website. Amazon features a billing dashboard which allows the user to check their monthly balance, which is then split into spending on each service. This would allow TipTop music to maximise their efficiency of spending when the free trial runs out.
            </p>
            <h3>Microsoft Azure
            </h3>
            <p>Jovanovic et al. (2014) describes Microsoft Azure as “a flexible cloud platform that allows its users fast development, debugging and iteration of their applications as well as their further management through a network of Microsoft data centres”. Due to Azures flexibility, applications can be developed with any programming language, tool or existing framework. This would give TipTop music freedom to build the website using any methods they prefer. As with Amazon Web Services, Microsoft offer a free tier service, although they approach it differently. Microsoft offer £150 of free credit for use of any of azure’s services, which depending on how much resources the user would need to use, may either last longer or shorter than amazons offering.
            </p>
            <h1>Conclusion
            </h1>
            <p>To summarise, Cloud computing provides a number of benefits that can be appealing to business enterprises. By using an infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), enterprises can generate massive cost savings because the service provides computing power, storage and networking which would otherwise need to be purchased and maintained by the user. Amazon Web Services, specifically EC2 seems to be the best option for TipTop music. The rapid deployment and elasticity would benefit the website greatly, allowing for the website to be online as quick as possible, while also accounting for any sudden influxes of traffic the site may receive should a band go viral. Amazon are also a great option when considering security. Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority. Their data centre and network architecture is built to meet the most security-sensitive organisations.
